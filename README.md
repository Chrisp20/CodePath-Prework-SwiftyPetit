## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App 1: Safari
- This app is my go to whenever I need to search something up.
- Bookmark tabs that I can use later.


App 2: Gmail
- My go to email app.
- Very organized with my important mail, spam, social media, and promotion mail.

App 3: Messages
- Whenever I need to get in contact with someone I text them.
- A good alternative to communication on the phone and can share funny
pictures and videos with one another.


App 4: YouTube
- My favorite streaming services
- Has thousands of videos that can entertain and inform me, all for free.

An app idea that I would like to build is a travel social media. 
Strictly used to share travel plans and tips for your followers. 
Can make a deal with travel advisors that will allow the purchasing of plane tickets from the app
by directing them to the website for example JetBlue partnership with the app.

## Notes

- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background.
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
